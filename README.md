# LoopsBase (in Dart)

A comprehensive, visually stunning Flutter application designed to master **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Design Patterns**, and **Refactoring Techniques** using the Dart programming language.

## Overview

**LoopsBase** is more than just a reference app; it's an interactive learning ecosystem for Dart developers. Whether you are a beginner looking to understand "Separation of Concerns" or a senior engineer refining your "Design Pattern" knowledge, this app provides clear, concise, and professional examples.

Built with a focus on developer experience, the app features a responsive design, interactive code blocks, and a robust architecture using industry-standard state management.

## Key Features

### 1. Design Patterns Catalogue
Explore a comprehensive library of design patterns categorized by their purpose. Each pattern includes:
- **Concept & Definition**: Clear explanation of the pattern.
- **Real-world Analogy**: To make complex concepts relatable.
- **Code Implementation**: "Bad vs. Good" implementation comparisons.
- **Visual Diagrams**: (Coming soon) To illustrate structure and flow.

| Category | Patterns |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Creational** | Singleton, Factory Method, Builder, Abstract Factory, Prototype |
| **Structural** | Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Proxy |
| **Behavioral** | Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Chain of Responsibility, Iterator |

### 2. Refactoring Suite
Master the art of improving code without changing its external behavior.
- **Composing Methods**: Extract Method, Inline Method, Extract Variable.
- **Moving Features**: Move Method, Move Field, Extract Class.
- **Organizing Data**: Self Encapsulate Field, Replace Data Value with Object.

### 3. Interview Preparation
Prepare for your next technical interview with a curated list of OOP and common programming questions.
- **Categorized by Difficulty**: Entry, Intermediate, and Advanced.
- **Detailed Answers**: In-depth explanations for each question.
- **Bookmarking**: Save important questions to review later.
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find questions by topic or difficulty.

### 4. Programming Terms
A glossary of essential programming concepts and terminology.
- **Searchable Database**: Quickly find definitions.
- **Category Filtering**: Filter terms by OOP, Clean Code, Architecture, etc.
- **Persistent Bookmarks**: Keep your most-used terms handy.

## Core Capabilities

- **Dynamic Theme Engine**: Seamless switching between Light and Dark modes.
- **Localization Support**: Multi-language support (AR/EN) built with `flutter_localizations`.
- **Font Scaling**: Adjust the app's font scale dynamically for better readability.
- **State Persistence**: Powered by `HydratedBloc`, your preferences (theme, locale, bookmarks) are saved across sessions.
- **Premium UI**: Custom design system with smooth micro-animations and Material 3 principles.
- **Developer-First Code**: Code blocks use **FiraCode** with ligatures for a professional look.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) (Latest Material 3)
- **Language**: [Dart](https://dart.dev)
- **State Management**: [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) & [HydratedBloc](https://pub.dev/packages/hydrated_bloc)
- **Dependency Injection**: [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it)
- **Vector Graphics**: [flutter_svg](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg)
- **Icons**: Material Icons & Custom SVGs

## Architectural Decisions

- **Feature-First Structure**: The project is organized by features (e.g., `design_patterns`, `interview_questions`) rather than layers, making it easier to scale and maintain.
- **Bloc Pattern**: Uses `flutter_bloc` for UI logic and `HydratedBloc` for persistent app settings and user preferences.
- **Service Locator**: Employs `get_it` for clean dependency injection, ensuring components are loosely coupled and testable.
- **Extension-Driven UI**: Extensive use of `BuildContext` extensions to access themes (`context.colorScheme`), localization (`context.l10n`), and media queries concisely.
- **Design System (DL)**: Centralized layout constants in the `DL` class to maintain UI consistency (spacing, padding, border radii).

---

## Design Patterns Support
The app implements a full hierarchy of design patterns:
- **Gang of Four (GoF)**: Classic creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.
- **Modern Patterns**: Contemporary patterns used in reactive and cloud-native development.
- **Practical Patterns**: Patterns specific to the Flutter/Dart ecosystem (e.g., Repository, BLoC).

Each pattern entry provides a deep dive into its **Pros**, **Cons**, **When to Use**, and **Common Mistakes**, along with cross-references to **Related Patterns**.
